## Rock Paper Scissors

This is rock, paper, scissors game. 

The game starts by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

You need to type one of the options to compete against the computer. 

In the developing of this project I learned: 
* How to store the user's input.
* How to generate a random choice for the computer.
* How to compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
* How to give feedback to the user.
